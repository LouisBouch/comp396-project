# Comp 396 project: Habitability simulator (2D/3D?)

## Overview

This simulation aims to serve as an interactive tool to better understand and visualize the necessary conditions for life to emerge on planets in a solar system.  
To do so, it will simulate the motions of planets, suns and other various celestial bodies as they interact through gravity. The habitability of each planet will be computed based on the intensity of the suns, their proximity and atmospheric conditions.  
More aspect are likely to be considered as the project evolves.
